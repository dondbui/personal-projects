# ugui-experiments
This project is for my own personal experimentation with Unity's GUI systems

![Splash](https://github.com/dondbui/personal-projects/raw/master/ugui-experiments/Screenshots/splash01.gif)

### What Works:
- Splash Screen transition to Loading Screen
- Force point filter on text to maintain the crisp pixel font
- Triggering of the fade animation 
- Transitions between title screen and load file screen

- Going back with the escape button
